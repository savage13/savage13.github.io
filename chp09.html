    <a name="p01"/><h2>Problem 9.1</h2>
    <p>
    These problems are notoriously difficult, even more so than other problems in this course as they are inherently 3D.
    <p>
      Use the Diagrams in Figure 9.6 to help you understand how to determine the amount of offset along the fault.
    <p>
      First is to find the <b>pitch</b> of the secondary feature, here a dike, in the fault.  Do you remember how to determine the pitch of something? On a Stereonet, rotate the fault to North-South and count small-circles from the north or south pole to the intersection of the fault and the dike; this is the pitch.
    <p>
      Draw the pitch angle onto the map with the strike of the fault being 0 degrees rotating positive towards the dip.
    <p>
      Dy drawing this angle you are effectively drawing the orientation of the dike on the footwall, i.e. the fault plane.
    <p>
      Using the relative motion on the fault, here defined as a normal fault (What does that mean?), measure the offset along the fault plane.
    <p>
      The angle is measured from the strike at 0 degress rotating positive towards down dip. Or Along the strike is 0.0, down dip is 90 degrees.
    <p>
      <b>Hint:</b> A normal fault has slip that is directly down dip.
    <p>
      Use a ruler to measure the distance. Done.
      
      <a name="p02"/><h2>Problem 9.2</h2>
    <p>
      Use the steronet and the map diagram drawn before. Now just change the orientation of the slip to be 60 degrees, not a normal fault, e.g. 90 degrees.
    <p>
      Again, measure the slip. Done.
      
    <a name="p05"/><h2>Problem 9.5</h2>
    <p>
    Follow the instructions and use the map provided to answer the questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Most of the faults are the usual kinds, except for Fault B.  Bracket the age range using the available units.
      <!--For each fault (A, B, C, D, and E) determine the type of faulting that has occurred and bracket the age of faulting as precisely as possible.-->
      

    <p>
      2. As in the previous part, the names of the features and structures are the usual names you have been exposed to, except for Locatities (f) and (g).  See the lab manual for these terms.
      <!-- 2 Identify the following features indicated by cir- cled, lower-case letters on the map.
(a) Type of contacts at localities a, b, c, and d. (b) Specific geologic structure present at local-
ities e, f, g, and h. -->
      <p>  3. Should be "reasonable". (Famous last words)
        <!-- 3 The strike and dip directions that are shown are
correct; however, three of the dips are actually overturned. Correct these directly on the map by substituting the correct symbol for overturned beds.-->
      <p> 4. Look at the relationship between the Miocene units and the faults that interact (touch?) it 
        <!-- 4 Is the unit on the east side of the map labeled ‘‘Tm’’ older or younger than the other Miocene rocks on the map? Give a reason for your answer. -->
      <p>  5. This one is difficult, Look at the Fensters surronding Fault C.
        <!-- 5 Determine the minimum amount of displace- ment on fault C.-->
      <p> Instead of a paragraph, how about a bulleted list of the things that happened. Do not forget Deposition and Erosion.
        <!-- 6 Write a one-paragraph geologic history of the map area. Include all episodes of deposition, erosion, and plutonism. Also indicate when spe- cific deformational styles (folding and faulting) occurred. -->
