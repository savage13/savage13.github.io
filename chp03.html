    <p>
    <b> Determine the Strike and Dip of a Bed</b>
      
    <p>
    This is your <a href="chp02.html#p03">three-point problem friend</a> again, but somewhat simplified.

    <p>
      Find a topographic contour that intersects the base of the unit twice: <b>This is the strike.</b> Draw that structure contour.
    <p>
      Find a different topographic contour that intersects the base of the unit twice. Draw that structure contour.
    <p>
      Use the diference in elevation, \(\Delta z\) and the horizontal distance in real-world units, \(\Delta x\) perpendicular to the structure contours, or the strike to <b>determine the dip</b> of the unit via $$\delta = \tan^{-1}\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta x}$$

      
    <p>
      <b>Warning:</b> Sometimes the units do not have more than one explicit contour that intersects the base.  Be resourceful and creative.

    <p>
      <b>Determining the Thickness of a Bed</b>

    <p>
      The best place to measure the thickness is where the topography is flat or along a topographic contour; provided that contour is perpendicular to the strike \(\theta\).  The dips of the bed are available. Use the equation $$t = \Delta x \sin \delta$$ where \(t\) is the thickness, \(\Delta x\) is the horizontal distance and \(\delta\) is the bed's dip.
    <p>
      If it is not flat, you will need to use a slightly more complex set of equations:
    <p>
      If the bedding dips more steeply than topography in the same direction
      $$ t = \Delta x \sin \delta - \Delta z \cos\delta $$
    <p>
      If the bedding dips less steeply than topography in the same direction
      $$ t = \Delta z \cos\delta - \Delta x \sin \delta  $$
    <p>
      If the bedding dips in the opposite direction to topography 
      $$ t = \Delta x \sin \delta + \Delta z \cos\delta    $$
