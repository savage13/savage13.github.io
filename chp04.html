    <a name="p01"/><h2>Problem 4.1</h2>

    Transfer bed contacts from the map to the cross section
    <p>
    That symbol that looks like a strike-dip symbol with the curly thing is an overturned bed
    <p>
    Use the dips contained within the bed to define the dips of the bed in the cross section
    <p>
    But dont make them too long because we will need to connect them.
    <p>
    Now, you need to make sure which side is "up".
    <p>
    The overturned bed has the upfacing or younging direction pointing down and a normal bed has the younging direction pointing up.
    <p>
    I like to use little arrows to indicate the younging direction
    <p>
    The beds can connect either 1) above or 2) below the surface
    <p>
    How do you pick which one?
    By using the younging direction
    <p>
    If you "unfold" the bed, the correct direction should be where the younging direction points up. *Provide the entire structure has not been overturned.*

    <a name="p02"/><h2>Problem 4.2</h2>

    Draw the cross section along A-A'
    <p>
    Start by putting in the fault, it has a dip iof 82 degrees towards the east, but the strike of the fault is not perpendicular to the cross section, so an apparent dip needs to be computed.  I will be nice and do this one as an example.
    <p>
    The strike of the fault is approximately N15W.  The apparent dip direction is West, or N90W.  This means that beta (the difference between the strike and the apparnet dip is 75 degrees)
    <p>
    Using the apparent dip equation as in the previous chapters
    <p>
      $$\tan \delta = \tan \alpha / \sin \beta$$
    <p>
    we can solve for the apparnet dip \(\alpha\).
    <p>
      $$\tan \alpha = \tan 82^\circ \sin 75^\circ$$
    <p>
      $$\alpha = 81.72^\circ$$
    <p>
    The apparent dip is not much different than the true dip.  This is because the orientation, or stirke, of the bed is alomost 90 degrees to the cross section.
    <p>
    So we will use the value of 82 degrees and not quibble about 0.8 degrees.
    <p>
    You can now draw in the western block and Fm. K using the dips as they are, but if you feel like reducing the dip just a little bit, thats ok.
    <p>
    The eastern most arm of the western fault block has its dip on the other side of the fault.  It is ok to use this.
    <p>
    Again, remember to transfer the Fm K outcrops along A-A' onto your Cross section
    <p>
    For the eastern fault block, the western most arm can probably be put in with a apparent dip close to the actual dip of 42.
    <p>
    The eastern arm of Fm K in the eastern fault block is not perpendicular to the cross section.  It is more like 45 degrees.  Therefore, we need to use the apparent dip equation from above.
    <p>
    Compute it, draw in the bed and connect it to the other arm of Fm K.
    <p>
    Almost done
    <p>
    Put in the Dike.  You will need to use the apparent dip formulat
    <p>
    Put in the Quartz diorite.  This is an igneous intrusion.  So, uh, I will let you figure that one out
    <p>
