    <a name="p01"/><h2>Problem 10.1</h2>

    Along the intersection of the planes is \( \sigma_2 \)
    The large angle between the plane is where \( \sigma_3 \) is and the narrow angle is where \( \sigma_1 \) is. For reference see Figure 10.3.  Remember all of the principal stresses are perpendicualr to each other.
    
    <a name="p02"/><h2>Problem 10.2</h2>
    Plot all of the planes on a stereonet.  For now, you can ignore the slickenlines.
    <p>
      As with the previous problem, the intersection of the planes is \(\sigma_2\), best to place this on the edge of the stereonet (horizontal) or at the center (vertical) of the stereonet.  Because you set of the stresses either to be horizontal or vertical then the other stress must be either vertical or horizontal. However, in general, the stresses do not have to be constrained to horizontal or vertical.
    </p>
    <p>
    Again, \(\sigma_1\) is in the acute angle and \( \sigma_3 \) is in the obtuse angle
    <a name="p02"/><h2>Problem 10.3</h2>
    <b>Note</b> Figure 10.5 in the problem is a <b>Map</b>
    <p> Plot the planes, find the stresses.  You have done this before in the last problem.
    
    <a name="p02"/><h2>Problem 10.8</h2>
    This problem is taken from a famous <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/10/12/611/203380">paper</a> about the tectonics in Tibet.  You do not need the paper to do the problem.
    <p>
      This one takes some time, so follow the directions.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> As the problem asks, put the horizontal stresses on the Figure G-30
      <li> Do Figure G-31c first, it has the most developed faults and should correspond to what is actually happening now.  Draw the fault and put in the stress orientations.
      <li> Now do the same for G-31a and G-31b
      <li> Describe what happens to the faulting in Tibet over time, from G-31a throught G-31c.
    </ol>
